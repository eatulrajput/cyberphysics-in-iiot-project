# Project
- Cyber Physics in Industrial IOT Group Project

## Requirements:
- NodeMCU (ESP8266)
- Breadboard
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- USB Cable
- Jumper Wires
- Arduino IDE Software

## Conclusion:
You can read the project file, it is in `pdf format` and I am concluding it now, in conclusion, the experiment on "Distance Measurement Using HC-SR04 Via NodeMCU (ESP8266)" has provided valuable insights into the integration of ultrasonic sensors with IoT platforms for accurate and wireless distance measurements. The challenges encountered during the project, including circuit connections, code errors, and accuracy issues, have been addressed through systematic testing, debugging, and calibration efforts.
